/**
 * ddb-live-importer.js
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Standalone GM tool. No other modules required, no saved API token.
 *
 * Flow (no bookmarklet, no dragging):
 *   1. GM clicks "Import from D&D Beyond" (Actor Directory footer) for a
 *      brand new character, OR right-clicks an existing actor and picks
 *      "Convert to D&D Beyond Character" to re-sync one that already exists.
 *   2. Dialog opens; "Open D&D Beyond" launches a real browser tab to the
 *      GM's own (already logged in) D&D Beyond account.
 *   3. GM picks their campaign, then a character, then pastes that
 *      character's URL (or just the ID number) into the box.
 *   4. "Get Character JSON" opens the raw character data in a new tab (a
 *      plain link — no script runs on D&D Beyond's page at all).
 *   5. GM selects all (Ctrl+A) and copies (Ctrl+C) on that page.
 *   6. Back in Foundry, GM pastes (Ctrl+V) into the text box and clicks
 *      "Import Character." This module reads that text, maps the data (see
 *      ddb-mapper.js), swaps items for real compendium items where it can,
 *      and either creates a new actor, updates the actor being converted,
 *      or updates an existing actor matched by name.
 *
 * The character ID is saved on the actor afterward, so next time it's
 * pre-filled automatically for a quick re-sync.
 *
 * GM Sync Panel (game.settings.registerMenu, see the "init" hook at the
 * bottom): lists every character already linked to D&D Beyond in one place,
 * with a "sync one" button per character and a "sync all" button. "Sync all"
 * still can't reach D&D Beyond directly from Foundry's page (confirmed:
 * D&D Beyond blocks cross-origin fetches from any other site, CORS, so
 * there is no way to auto-pull by character ID alone without a browser tab
 * open to D&D Beyond itself) -- so it works by having the GM paste a short
 * script into a D&D Beyond tab's own console once per batch (that script
 * fetches every linked character with the GM's real login and copies the
 * results), then pasting those results back into the Sync Panel.
